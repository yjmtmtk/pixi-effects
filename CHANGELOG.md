# Changelog

## Unreleased

**Added**

- `examples/gallery/blueprint-house.html` (31st piece): a blueprint that draws itself with `trimEnd`, `visibleChars` and `set: { text }`.
- Draw-on strokes: `trimStart` / `trimEnd` (0–1 of the outline, animatable) on `line`, `polygon`, `path`, `rect`, `circle` and `ellipse`. `trimEnd: 0` plus a keyframe `to: { trimEnd: 1 }` draws it on; `trimStart` wipes it off; both give a travelling dash. The fill is not trimmed. A rect starts top-left and a circle at 12 o'clock, both clockwise; a polygon counts its closing edge; an SVG path's curves are followed. Not for `arc` (it warns: animate `endAngle`). `examples/14-draw-on.html`.
- Text that changes over time: a keyframe `set: { text: 'Two' }` swaps the string at that time (undone on seek back), and `visibleChars` (a number, the first N characters) is a typewriter. `to` / `from` with `text` warn: a string cannot be tweened. The `{value}` lint knows about swapped strings.
- `movie.on('play', fn)`: emitted when `play()` starts a paused movie.

**Fixed**

- The player bar showed the ▶ icon while a host page's `movie.play()` was running (it only updated for its own button): it follows the movie's `'play'` / `'pause'` events now.
- `movie.play()` before the browser allows sound (an AudioContext stays `suspended` until a user gesture): the picture ran on silently and the audio was scheduled at a stale position. It now starts the sound when the context runs (it asks to resume again on the first click / key press), from the position the movie has reached by then.
- Gallery: a deep link or a reload opened the piece at its poster frame (e.g. 0:09). Every piece now opens at 0:00; a card click plays at once, a deep link keeps the poster with a play button (a browser would block the sound without a click).

## 0.5.0

**Added**

- Sound effects without files: an `audio` layer with `sfx: 'swoosh'` (or `{ preset, pitch, brightness, seed }`, or a custom `{ voices: [...] }`) plays a synthesised sound — click, pop, swoosh, swipe, hit, riser, chime, beep, coin, glitch, typewriter. The layer's `duration` is the sound's length. Deterministic; the synthesiser is a separate chunk loaded only when used.
- `ai/tools/check.mjs` (`npx pixi-effects-check page.html`): a one-command review for an AI author — its own private headless Chrome and static server, then warnings, `movie.inspect` over the whole timeline (grouped), `movie.inspectAudio()`, a contact sheet PNG, and a real export decoded again (video / audio length, loudness per second, silence); `report.json`; exit 0 / 1. No dependencies (Node ≥ 22 and an installed Chrome). Cut-off / off-canvas text fails the check; text overlaps are listed for review (7 of the 30 gallery pieces overlap on purpose), `--strict` fails on them.
- `measureText(text, style)` and `splitText(text, style, { by: 'chars' | 'words' | 'lines', x, y, align })`: text layout with the renderer's own font metrics, for per-letter / per-word animation (and sizing pills) without hand-measuring.
- `shape: 'arc'` — progress rings, pie and donut slices (`radius`, `innerRadius`, `startAngle`, `endAngle` in degrees, all animatable) — and `strokeCap` / `strokeJoin` on every shape.
- An `audio` layer's starting volume may be written `initial: { volume }` (it was silently ignored there and played at 1) as well as `volume`.
- Text counters: `format: { pad: 2 }` zero-pads the whole part (`18:42:05`); a `{value}` placeholder that nothing sets or animates warns that it prints 0.
- `movie.inspectAudio()`: each sound's length, level, loudest moment and brightness (Hz), when it plays, the mix over time, and issues (limited mix, inaudible or cut-off sounds).
- The audio mix is soft-limited above 0.9 (a quieter mix is unchanged) and warns, naming the layers, when it would have clipped.

**Fixed**

- MP4 / MOV exports: the audio started ~45 ms after the picture (AAC encoder priming). It is now trimmed with an edit list.
- `colorSpace: 'oklch'` from or to a nearly grey colour (`#9a9ab4`) swept through pink: a low-chroma endpoint now borrows the other end's hue.
- `blendMode` on a layer with `filters` (a blurred `multiply` glow rendered black) goes through the last filter.
- An `image` / `video` used as a `mask` was drawn as a normal picture over the layer, and `maskInverted` looked ignored; sprite masks now stay hidden.
- A tilted `threeD` layer hidden because one corner passes the camera plane gets a warning that says so (it blamed `z`).
- `movie.inspect`: text in a panning composition is not "cut off", text scaled to 0 is not "no size".
- The seek / volume drag of the player ends when the pointerup never arrives (button released outside an iframe).
- sfx: a negative `at` or an end-relative keyframe past the start of a short sound crashed `movie.init()` (Web Audio rejects negative times): such a sound now starts at 0 with its first part cut off, with a warning; a non-number `duration` falls back to the preset length; silent custom voices (`from >= to`, `gain: 0`) and a non-numeric `seed` warn.
- `ai/template.html`: the player bar was wider than the canvas.

**Breaking (types)**

- `AudioSequenceSpec` is now `AudioAssetSpec | AudioSfxSpec`; `AudioDescriptor.buffer` is optional (a descriptor carries `buffer` or `synth`).

## 0.4.0

**Changed**

- A mask with no `at` of its own now starts and ends with the layer it masks, so its keyframes are measured from that layer's start (as `docs/dsl.md` always said: "shares its lifetime"). An explicit mask `at` is still composition time. **Migration:** a mask reveal that used `at: 0` on a layer that appears later now plays when the layer appears (before, it had finished long before). Give the mask an explicit `at` to keep the old timing.
- An `audio` layer with `loop: true` and no `duration` lasts until the composition ends (it used to stop after one clip length). Without `loop` and without `duration` it lasts as long as its clip, so a one-shot sound effect needs no `duration`.

**Fixed**

- **Volume keyframes** behaved unlike every other keyframe: a `to` ramped from the end of the previous keyframe, so the documented fade-out `{ at: -2, to: { volume: 0 }, duration: 2 }` faded the music across the whole piece, and `set` ramped towards its time instead of jumping. Each change now holds the current value until its own start, and keyframes apply in time order.
- A `set` keyframe (text `{value}` counter and fill, image tint, shape style) stayed applied after seeking back before it.
- **A shape could be missing after a jump seek** (contact sheet, snapshot, scrubbing): geometry was drawn only while rendering, after the culler had measured the previous frame's bounds, so a rect growing from `width: 0` at the left edge was culled. Shapes now redraw before the cull.
- `threeD` layers whose size changes (a growing shape, text) no longer make Pixi warn "destroyed while still bound": the render texture is resized in place.
- Text `style` words (`stroke: { join: 'round' }`, named colours, `textBaseline`, `whiteSpace`) were parsed as expressions and warned.
- `movie.inspect` judges overlaps on what is visible (cut to the canvas and the layer's mask), so a ticker parked off the canvas is not reported, and does not report the two scenes of a running transition.
- The same "keyframe starts after the layer ends" warning, printed once per layer by a loop, is summarised after three.
- `docs/dsl.md` contradicted itself on whether text content can change (it can, through `{value}`).

**Added**

- `blendMode: 'normal' | 'add' | 'screen' | 'multiply'` on every layer (a composition's children inherit it): glows and light leaks that add up.
- The four sample sound-effect mp3s (`examples/_assets/sfx-*.mp3`) are gone: the examples and all 23 gallery pieces that used them now use `sfx` presets (volumes matched to the old files within about 2 dB). `examples/_assets/bgm.mp3` is now a 16 s seamless loop of "One Cool Minute" (Loyalty Freak Music, CC0 1.0; see `examples/_assets/LICENSES.md`) instead of the 6 s drone; the gallery pieces' music volumes are retuned (peak 0.3, about −32 LUFS under the sound effects).
- `examples/gallery`: 30 portfolio pieces written as plain data by three AI models, with a showcase page, and the stumble notes that fed these fixes. `ai/reference/pitfalls.md` items 32–48.

## 0.3.0

**Breaking**

- Keyframe `at` is now measured from the start of the layer it belongs to (After Effects style); negative `at` counts back from that layer's end. Before, it was measured from the parent composition, so a keyframe with `at: 0` on a layer that starts at `at: 2` ran two seconds before the layer appeared, silently. Layers' own `at` and transitions' `at` are unchanged (composition time). `kenBurns`, `withFade` and transitions emit layer-local times. **Migration:** on a layer with `at: N`, subtract `N` from its keyframes' `at`.

**Fixed**

- **A layer could be missing right after a seek, or from an exported video.** PixiJS only culls inside `app.render()` (the ticker), and `Movie` draws by hand (and `render()` stops the ticker), so `culled` flags were stale: a layer that had just come on screen could be skipped. The movie now culls immediately before every draw.
- `line`, `polygon` and `path` without `x` / `y` were drawn around (0,0): their points are now plain canvas coordinates.
- Videos inside nested compositions started at the wrong time.
- Text `w` / `h` in expressions were measured before the style was applied.
- Shape geometry written in `initial` (`width`, `anchorX`, …) was silently ignored.
- 2.5D: hidden layers could keep a stale texture (`autoAlpha`), filter output was clipped at the layer edge, and render textures could use excessive memory.

**Added**

- Unknown option names now warn with a suggestion (`contactSheet({ cols })` → `columns`, `init({ fps })` → `frameRate`) instead of being ignored. `inspect(frame, { layers })` can list only the visible layers or none; it ignores faint layers and moving text.
- Warnings for the silent failures AI authors hit: keyframe or layer starting after its layer / composition ends, audio shorter than its layer without `loop`, a `threeD` layer hidden behind the camera, transitions on `threeD` layers, `lookAt` equal to the camera position, and more.
- Keyframes: `repeat` / `yoyo` / `repeatDelay` on every kind of animation (finite repeats only).
- Text counters: `text: '{value} users'` + animate `value`; `format: { decimals, grouping }`.
- Shapes: `fillGradient` — linear and radial gradients with alpha stops (vignettes).
- `orbit()` preset: a camera that circles a point (`dollyZoom: { from, to }` animates `fov` while the radius follows it).
- `movie.snapshot()`, `movie.contactSheet()`, `movie.inspect()`: look at the result — one frame, many labelled frames on one image, or per-layer bounds plus layout issues (text off the canvas, cut off, overlapping).
- `ai/` (skill, cheatsheet, tested recipes, pitfalls, starter template), `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`.

## 0.2.0

- 2.5D layers and camera (`threeD`, `z`, `rotationX/Y`, `{ type: 'camera' }`), the optional `pixi-effects/three` entry, `withFade`, shared-chunk builds.
